# PREDICT-MODEL

Why would you want to predict upcoming words, or assign probabilities to sentences?

Second, Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Mart√≠n (2014) in Chapter 4: N-Grams (Voice and Language Processing), probabilities are essential for identifying words with ambiguous meanings and spelling errors, as well as for speech recognition Or recognition of written letters. For example, in the film Take the Money and Run, Woody Allen tries to steal the bank by threatening the bank teller with a badly written note, which induces the cashier to read "I have a gub" instead of "I have a gun" Such a mistake could be avoided if the bank teller had a language processing system that would avoid misinterpretation by recognizing that the sequence "I have a gun" is much more likely than the non-word "I have a gub" Or something more absurd like "I have a ghoul".
